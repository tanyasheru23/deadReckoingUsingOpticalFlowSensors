# Dead-Reckoning-for-optical-based-sensors

<br>
In order to develop an accurate localization system for robots, we have implemented a dead reckoning system that relies on measuring the incremental movements of the robot directly from the floor using optical mouse sensors. These sensors allow us to measure the movement along two axes. To accurately calculate the robot's position and orientation deviation, it is essential to attach two optical mouse sensors to the robot. By analyzing the sensor values obtained from these sensors, we have conducted several experiments with the prototype to validate the effectiveness of the algorithm used in the system.
